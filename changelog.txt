Version: 1.7.3
Date: 2025-11-12

Version: 1.7.1
Date: 2025-11-05
  Changes:
    - Moved tooltip strings from Lua code to XML to allow for easier translation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
Date: 2025-11-01
  Changes:
    - Improvements to dedicated targeting core: 
    - Now you can no longer select an enemy room while they are cloaked and you have no vision.
    - Preemptive lock-on upgrade now instantly locks on a random enemy system at the start of battle, or cloaking if they have it
    - Improvements to infusion bay:
    - Now when clicking an infusion button, only selected crew will use the infusion. If you have no crew selected, they will all use the infusion like before.
    - Added 2 new Aether upgrades. They also now show what system they require in order to install them.
    - Introducing another new subsystem: Fiber Liner! (System bracers alternative)
    - While the System Bracers protect your systems, Fiber Liner protects your crew! (with an upgrade to protect your ship from fires and breaches too!)

Version: 1.6.5
Date: 2025-10-25

    - Buffed Dedicated Targeting Core:

    - Added the ability to disable locking on sounds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 2025-10-20
  Changes:
    - Debugged and fixed the sources of crashes, at least most of them. The "Continue" button should work far more stable now. (Managed to load the game 20 times in a row with no crashes.) Please report if you think there are still conditions that can cause a crash.

Date: 2025-10-18
  Changes:

    - An option to add an extra system slot for the current run via handy LilyInno hangar button now no longer boosts fleet, but instead reduces your max hull by 1/3
    - Reworked saving / loading code to work better and crash less... hopefully (but apparently not fixed completely unfortunately)

Date: 2025-10-02
